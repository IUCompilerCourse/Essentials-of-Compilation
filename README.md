# Essentials of Compilation

This is the LaTeX sources for two books, one about compiling a subset
of Racket to x86-64 assembly code and the other about compiling a
subset of Python, also to x86-64.

**Generating the book**

To generate the book (`build/book.pdf`), run the `make` command (assuming
you have a full install of TeX Live).

If you are an instructor, you may also request access to the reference
implementation of the compiler and the full test suite.
