	Abstract = {An important property of the Newell Shaw-Simon scheme for computer storage of lists is that data having multiple occurrences need not be stored at more than one place in the computer. That is, lists may be ``overlapped.'' Unfortunately, overlapping poses a problem for subsequent erasure. Given a list that is no longer needed, it is desired to erase just those parts that do not overlap other lists. In LISP, McCarthy employs an elegant but inefficient solution to the problem. The present paper describes a general method which enables efficient erasure. The method employs interspersed reference counts to describe the extent of the overlapping.},

@inproceedings{Osterlund:2016aa,
	Abstract = { On-the-fly Garbage Collectors (GCs) are the state-of-the-art concurrent GC algorithms today. Everything is done concurrently, but phases are separated by blocking handshakes. Hence, progress relies on the scheduler to let application threads (mutators) run into GC checkpoints to reply to the handshakes. For a non-blocking GC, these blocking handshakes need to be addressed. Therefore, we propose a new non-blocking handshake to replace previous blocking handshakes. It guarantees scheduling-independent operation level progress without blocking. It is scheduling independent but requires some other OS support. It allows bounded waiting for threads that are currently running on a processor, regardless of threads that are not running on a processor. We discuss this non-blocking handshake in two GC algorithms for stack scanning and copying objects. They pave way for a future completely non-blocking GC by solving hard open theory problems when OS support is permitted. The GC algorithms were integrated to the G1 GC of OpenJDK for Java. GC pause times were reduced to 12.5% compared to the original G1 on average in DaCapo. For a memory intense benchmark, latencies were reduced from 174 ms to 0.67 ms for the 99.99% percentile. The improved latency comes at a cost of 15% lower throughput. },

@inproceedings{Jacek:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Generational garbage collectors are one of the most common types of automatic memory management. We can minimize the costs they incur by carefully choosing the points in a program's execution at which they run. However, this decision is generally based on simple, crude heuristics. Instead, we train random forest classifiers to decide when to collect based on features gathered from a running program. This reduces the total cost of collection in both time and space. We demonstrate useful generalization of learned policies to unseen traces of the same program, showing this approach may be fruitful for further investigation.},

	Abstract = {Modern hardware and applications require runtime systems that can operate under large-heap and low-latency requirements. For many client/server or interactive applications, reducing average and maximum pause times is more important than maximizing throughput.  The GHC Haskell runtime system version 8.10.1 offers a new latency-optimized garbage collector as an alternative to the existing throughput-optimized copying garbage collector. This paper details the latency-optimized GC design, which is a generational collector integrating GHC's existing collector and bump-pointer allocator with a non-moving collector and non-moving heap suggested by Ueno and Ohori. We provide an empirical analysis on the latency/throughput tradeoffs. We augment the established nofib micro benchmark with a response-time focused benchmark that simulates real-world applications such as LRU caches, web search, and key-value stores.},

	Abstract = {Despite the fact that protection mechanisms like StackGuard, ASLR and NX are widespread, the development on new defense strategies against stack-based buffer overflows has not yet come to an end. In this paper, we present a compiler-level protection called SCADS: Separated Control- and Data-Stacks. In our approach, we protect return addresses and saved frame pointers on a separate stack, called the Control-Stack (CS). In common computer programs, a single user mode stack is used to store control information next to data buffers. By separating control information from the Data-Stack (DS), we protect sensitive pointers of a program's control flow from being overwritten by buffer overflows. As we make control flow information simply unreachable for buffer overflows, many exploits are stopped at an early stage of progression with only little performance overhead. To substantiate the practicability of our approach, we provide SCADS as an open source patch for the LLVM compiler infrastructure for AMD64 hosts.},

	Abstract = {Common subexpression elimination is a well-known compiler optimisation that saves time by avoiding the repetition of the same computation. In lazy functional languages, referential transparency renders the identification of common subexpressions very simple. More common subexpressions can be recognised because they can be of arbitrary type whereas standard common subexpression elimination only shares primitive values. However, because lazy functional languages decouple program structure from data space allocation and control flow, analysing its effects and deciding under which conditions the elimination of a common subexpression is beneficial proves to be quite difficult. We developed and implemented the transformation for the language Haskell by extending the Glasgow Haskell compiler. On real-world programs the transformation showed nearly no effect. The reason is that common subexpressions whose elimination could speed up programs are uncommon in lazy functional languages.},

	Abstract = {Flow typing is becoming a popular mechanism for typing existing programs written in untyped languages (e.g. JavaScript, Racket, Groovy). Such systems require intersections for the true-branch of a type test, negations for the false-branch, and unions to capture the flow of information at meet points. Type systems involving unions, intersections and negations require a subtype operator which is non-trivial to implement. Frisch et al. demonstrated that this problem was decidable. However, their proof was not constructive and does not lend itself naturally to an implementation. In this paper, we present a sound and complete algorithm for subtype testing in the presence of unions, intersections and negations.},

The paper gives an operational semantics of cost for a simple strict functional language in terms of $\lambda$-calculus $\beta$-reduction steps and introduces type rules describing cost effects. The type system is based on intersection types. The use of discrete polymorphism (intersection types) instead of the usual parametric polymorphism approach improves the analysis and solves, in many cases, the ``size aliasing problem'' that has been identified as a limitation on previous type-and-effect approaches. Finally we provide a proof of the soundness of our effect system with respect to the cost semantics.},

We prove several meta- mathematical properties for these systems including cut elimination, subject reduction, coherence, and decidability of type reconstruction. Following the approach by J. Mitchell, the sequents are given a simple semantics using logical relations over applicative structures. The systems are complete with respect to this semantics. The logic which emerges from this paper can be seen as a successor to the original Hilbert style system proposed by J. Mitchell in 1988, and to the ``half way'' sequent calculus of G. Longo, K. Milsted, and S. Soloviev proposed in 1995.},

@article{Nygaard:2004aa,
	Abstract = {A simple domain theory for concurrency is presented. Based on a categorical model of linear logic and associated comonads, it highlights the role of linearity in concurrent computation. Two choices of comonad yield two expressive metalanguages for higher-order processes, both arising from canonical constructions in the model. Their denotational semantics are fully abstract with respect to contextual equivalence. One language derives from an exponential of linear logic; it supports a straightforward operational semantics with simple proofs of soundness and adequacy. The other choice of comonad yields a model of affine-linear logic, and a process language with a tensor operation to be understood as a parallel composition of independent processes. The domain theory can be generalised to presheaf models, providing a more refined treatment of nondeterministic branching. The article concludes with a discussion of a broader programme of research, towards a fully fledged domain theory for concurrency.},

The set of typeable terms can be characterized in the same way, the system is complete with respect to the simple type semantics, and it has the principal type property.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that a reflexive object in the Cartesian closed category of complete partial orders and Scott-continuous functions is a model of λ-calculus (briefly a topological model). A topological model, through the interpretation function, induces a λ-theory, i.e., a congruence relation on λ-terms closed under α- and β-reduction. It is natural to ask if all possible λ-theories are induced by a topological model, i.e., if topological models are complete w.r.t. λ-calculus. The authors prove an Approximation Theorem, which holds in all topological models. Using this theorem, they analyze some topological models and their induced λ-theories, and they exhibit a λ-theory which cannot be induced by a topological model. So they prove that topological models are not complete w.r.t. λ-calculus.},

	Abstract = {Perpetual strategies in λ-calculus are analyzed from a semantical perspective. This is achieved using suitable denotational models, computationally adequate with respect to the observational (operational) equivalence, ≈p, induced by perpetual strategies. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for an ω-algebraic lattice, isomorphic to the space of its strict continuous self-maps, to be computationally adequate w.r.t. ≈p. While many such models exist, it is shown, however, that none is fully abstract w.r.t. ≈p. The computationally adequate lattice model Dp is studied in detail. It is used to give a semantical proof of the Conservation Theorem for the λ-calculus, and to provide coinductive and mixed inductive-coinductive characterizations of ≈p. The coinductive characterization allows to show that the term model of ≈p is a denotational model; this yields a new characterization of perpetual redexes in λ-calculus.},

	Abstract = {We show how to characterise compositionally a number of evaluation properties of λ-terms using Intersection Type assignment systems. In particular, we focus on termination properties, such as strong normalisation, normalisation, head normalisation, and weak head normalisation. We consider also the persistent versions of such notions. By way of example, we consider also another evaluation property, unrelated to termination, namely reducibility to a closed term. Many of these characterisation results are new, to our knowledge, or else they streamline, strengthen, or generalise earlier results in the literature. The completeness parts of the characterisations are proved uniformly for all the properties, using a set-theoretical semantics of intersection types over suitable kinds of stable sets. This technique generalises Krivine's and Mitchell's methods for strong normalisation to other evaluation properties.},

	Abstract = {The evaluation function of a syntactic theory is canonically defined as the transitive closure of (1) decomposing a program into an evaluation context and a redex, (2) contracting this redex, and (3) plugging the result in the context. Directly implementing this evaluation function therefore yields an interpreter with a worst-case overhead, for each step, that is linear in the size of the input program. We present sufficient conditions over a syntactic theory to circumvent this overhead, and illustrate the method with an interpreter for the call-by-value λ-calculus and a transformation into continuation-passing style (CPS). In particular, we mechanically change the time complexity of this CPS transformation from potentially quadratic to linear. An extended version is available as the technical report BRICS RS-01-03 [4].},

@article{Urban:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We present a generalisation of first-order unification to the practically important case of equations between terms involving binding operations. A substitution of terms for variables solves such an equation if it makes the equated terms α-equivalent, i.e. equal up to renaming bound names. For the applications we have in mind, we must consider the simple, textual form of substitution in which names occurring in terms may be captured within the scope of binders upon substitution. We are able to take a ``nominal'' approach to binding in which bound entities are explicitly named (rather than using nameless, de~Bruijn-style representations) and yet get a version of this form of substitution that respects α-equivalence and possesses good algorithmic properties. We achieve this by adapting two existing ideas. The first one is terms involving explicit substitutions of names for names, except that here we only use explicit permutations (bijective substitutions). The second one is that the unification algorithm should solve not only equational problems, but also problems about the freshness of names for terms. There is a simple generalisation of classical first-order unification problems to this setting which retains the latter's pleasant properties: unification problems involving α-equivalence and freshness are decidable; and solvable problems possess most general solutions.},

	Abstract = {HOL Light is an interactive proof assistant for classical higher-order logic, intended as a clean and simplified version of Mike Gordon's original HOL system. Theorem provers in this family use a version of ML as both the implementation and interaction language; in HOL Light's case this is Objective CAML (OCaml). Thanks to its adherence to the so-called `LCF approach', the system can be extended with new inference rules without compromising soundness. While retaining this reliability and programmability from earlier HOL systems, HOL Light is distinguished by its clean and simple design and extremely small logical kernel. Despite this, it provides powerful proof tools and has been applied to some non-trivial tasks in the formalization of mathematics and industrial formal verification.},

	Abstract = {Being able to combine static and dynamic typing within the same language has clear benefits in order to support the evolution of prototypes or scripts into mature robust programs. While being an emblematic dynamic object-oriented language, Smalltalk is lagging behind in this regard. We report on the design, implementation and application of Gradualtalk, a gradually-typed Smalltalk meant to enable incremental typing of existing programs. The main design goal of the type system is to support the features of the Smalltalk language, like metaclasses and blocks, live programming, and to accommodate the programming idioms used in practice. We studied a number of existing projects in order to determine the features to include in the type system. As a result, Gradualtalk is a practical approach to gradual types in Smalltalk, with a novel blend of type system features that accommodate most programming idioms.},

	Abstract = {We study the efficient implementation of call-by-value using the structure of interactive computation models. This structure has been useful in applications to resource-bounded compilation, but much of the existing work in this area has focused on call-by-name programming languages. This paper works towards the goal of a simple, efficient treatment of call-by-value languages. In previous work we have studied cps-translation as an approach to implementing call-by-value and have observed that it needs to be refined in order to achieve efficient space usage. In this paper we give an alternative presentation of the refined translation, which is close to existing methods of typed closure conversion. We show that a simple correctness proof following Benton and Hur is possible for this formulation. Moreover, we extend previous work to cover full recursion in the source language.},

	Abstract = {The VLISP project has produced a rigorously verified compiler from Scheme to byte codes, and a verified interpreter for the resulting byte codes. The official denotational semantics for Scheme provides the main criterion of correctness. The Wand-Clinger technique was used to prove correctness of the primary compiler step. Then a state machine operational semantics is proved to be faithful to the denotational semantics. The remainder of the implementation is verified by a succession of state machine refinement proofs. These include proofs that garbage collection is a sound implementation strategy, and that a particular garbage collection algorithm is correct.},

@article{Oliva:1995aa,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a verified compiler for PreScheme, the implementation language for thevlisp run-time system. The compiler and proof were divided into three parts: A transformational front end that translates source text into a core language, a syntax-directed compiler that translates the core language into a combinator-based tree-manipulation language, and a linearizer that translates combinator code into code for an abstract stored-program machine with linear memory for both data and code. This factorization enabled different proof techniques to be used for the different phases of the compiler, and also allowed the generation of good code. Finally, the whole process was made possible by carefully defining the semantics ofvlisp PreScheme rather than just adopting Scheme's. We believe that the architecture of the compiler and its correctness proof can easily be applied to compilers for languages other than PreScheme.},

	Abstract = {Most authors use a classical Tarski-like definition of lambda-calculus models. However in earlier papers we constructed semantic ``models'' which do not obey this definition. We propose a new definition of models which is strictly more general than the usual one, takes care of all known cases, but is slightly more complicated. We illustrate the need for this definition by various examples, and compare it to the usual definition.},

	Abstract = {In his monograph [6], Dana Scott introduces us to a mathematical theory of computation. All values participating in computation, he says, are to be regarded as elements of certain structures called domains. and the existence of these domains in appropriate circumstances is guaranteed by the theory. All this mathematics provides firm foundations on which we may rely when we face the job of specifying the computations we wish to have performed: the theory means that we can be sure we know what we are talking about. In this Chapter we shall consider how these new insights may be exploited in the particular context of the specification of programming languages, by the technique known as Denotational Semantics. We indicate how three important features of conventional languages are handled --- assignment, declarations and scopes, and sequencing and jumps --- and at each stage we take the opportunity to exhibit a complete definition of ``the language so far'', even though each definition will require considerably reworking to accommodate the next stage.},

The purpose of the course was to provide the foundations needed for the method of denotational semantics; in particular I wanted to make the connections with recursive function theory more definite and to show how to obtain explicit, effectively given solutions to domain equations. Roughly, these chapters cover the first half of the book by Stoy, and he was able to continue the lectures the next term discussing semantical concepts following his text.},

	Abstract = {Strictly speaking the structures to be used are not lattices since as posets they will lack the top (or unit) element, but the adjunction of a top will make them complete lattices. The closure properties as posets, then, are closure underinf of any non-empty subset and sup of directed subsets. A family of subsets of a set closed underintersections of non-empty subfamilies and unions of directed subfamilies is a special type of poset with the closure properties where additionally every element is the directed sup (union) of the finite (``compact'') elements it contains. We call such posets finitary domains. (With a top they are just the well known algebraic lattices.) The continuous domains can be defined as the continuous retracts of finitary domains. A mapping between domains is continuous if it preserves direct sups. A map of a domain into itself is aretraction if it is idempotent. Starting with a finitary domain, the range (= fixed-point set) of a continuous retraction --- as a poset --- is a continuous domain. Numberless characterizations of continuous domains, both topological and order-theoretic, can be found in [2]. For the most part in the lectures we shall concentrate on the finitary domains, but the continuous domains find an interest as a generalization of interval analysis and by the connection with spaces of upper-semicontinuous functions.},

	Abstract = {Combinatory logic is based on modus ponens and a schematic (polymorphic) interpretation of axioms. In this paper we propose to consider expressive combinatory logics under the restriction that axioms are not interpreted schematically but ,,literally'', corresponding to a monomorphic interpretation of types. We thereby arrive at finite combinatory logic, which is strictly finitely axiomatisable and based solely on modus ponens. We show that the provability (inhabitation) problem for finite combinatory logic with intersection types is Exptime-complete with or without subtyping. This result contrasts with the general case, where inhabitation is known to be Expspace-complete in rank 2 and undecidable for rank 3 and up. As a by-product of the considerations in the presence of subtyping, we show that standard intersection type subtyping is in Ptime. From an application standpoint, we can consider intersection types as an expressive specification formalism for which our results show that functional composition synthesis can be automated.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce a system for the detection and elimination of dead code in typed functional programs. The main application of this method is the optimization of programs extracted from proofs in logical frameworks but it could be used as well in the elimination of dead code determined by program specialization. Our algorithm is based on a type inference system suitable for reasoning about dead code information. This system relays on refinement types which allow to exploit the type structure of the language for the investigation of program properties. The detection of dead code is obtained via type inference, which can be performed in an efficient and complete way, by reducing it to the solution of a system of inequalities between type variables. A key feature of our method is that program analysis can be performed in a strictly incremental way. Even though the language considered in the paper is a simply typed $\lambda$-calculus we can generalize our approach to polymorphic languages like ML. Although focused on dead code elimination our type inference method can also be applied to the investigation of other program properties like binding time and strictness. Some hints on these applications are given.},

	Abstract = {Consistent subtyping is employed in some gradual type systems to validate type conversions. The original definition by Siek and Taha serves as a guideline for designing gradual type systems with subtyping. Polymorphic types {\`a} la System F also induce a subtyping relation that relates polymorphic types to their instantiations. However Siek and Taha's definition is not adequate for polymorphic subtyping. The first goal of this paper is to propose a generalization of consistent subtyping that is adequate for polymorphic subtyping, and subsumes the original definition by Siek and Taha. The new definition of consistent subtyping provides novel insights with respect to previous polymorphic gradual type systems, which did not employ consistent subtyping. The second goal of this paper is to present a gradually typed calculus for implicit (higher-rank) polymorphism that uses our new notion of consistent subtyping. We develop both declarative and (bidirectional) algorithmic versions for the type system. We prove that the new calculus satisfies all static aspects of the refined criteria for gradual typing, which are mechanically formalized using the Coq proof assistant.},

	Abstract = {General refinement types allow types to be refined by predicates written in a general-purpose programming language, and can express function pre- and postconditions and data structure invariants. In this setting, with expressive and possibly verbose types, type reconstruction is particularly valuable, yet typeability is undecidable because it subsumes type checking. Using a generalized notion of type reconstruction, we present the first type reconstruction algorithm for a type system with base types refined by abitrary program terms. Our algorithm is a typeability-preserving transformation and defers type checking to a subsequent phase. The algorithm generates and solves a collection of implication constraints over refinement predicates, inferring maximally precise refinement predicates in a largely syntactic manner that is reminiscent of strongest postcondition calculation.

@article{Baltag:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We construct logical languages which allow one to represent a variety of possible types of changes affecting the information states of agents in a multi-agent setting. We formalize these changes by defining a notion of epistemic program. The languages are two-sorted sets that contain not only sentences but also actions or programs. This is as in dynamic logic, and indeed our languages are not significantly more complicated than dynamic logics. But the semantics is more complicated. In general, the semantics of an epistemic program is what we call aprogram model. This is a Kripke model of `actions',representing the agents' uncertainty about the current action in a similar way that Kripke models of `states' are commonly used in epistemic logic to represent the agents' uncertainty about the current state of the system. Program models induce changes affecting agents' information, which we represent as changes of the state model, called epistemic updates. Formally, an update consists of two operations: the first is called the update map, and it takes every state model to another state model, called the updated model; the second gives, for each input state model, a transition relation between the states of that model and the states of the updated model.},

	Abstract = {Inheritance is a standard means for reuse and for interfacing with external libraries. In a multi-language software product, extending a class written in a statically-typed language with a dynamically-typed class can require a significant number of manual indirections and other error-prone complications. Building on our previous interoperability work, we introduce a technique that allows safe, easy inheritance across languages. We demonstrate our technique for cross-language inheritance with a statically-typed object calculus and a dynamically-typed object calculus, where a statically-typed class can extend a dynamically-typed one and vice versa. We provide a proof sketch of soundness, as well as a guarantee that dynamic type errors do not arise due to statically-typed expressions.},

A central parameter that needs to be controlled to ensure efficient execution of task-parallel programs is the granularity of tasks. When they are too coarse-grained, scalability and load balance suffer, while very fine-grained tasks introduce execution overheads.},

@article{Zhang:2017aa,
	Abstract = {For large-scale graph analysis on a single PC, asynchronous processing methods are known to converge more quickly than the synchronous approach, because of more efficient propagation of vertices state. However, current asynchronous methods are still very suboptimal in propagating state across different graph partitions. This presents a bottleneck for cross-partition state update and slows down the convergence of the processing task. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method, named the HotGraph, to faster graph processing by extracting a backbone structure, called hot graph, that spans all the partitions of the original graph. With this approach, most cross-partition state propagations in traditional solutions now take place within only a few hot graph partitions, thus removing the cross-partition bottleneck. We also develop a partition scheduling algorithm to maximize the hot graph's effectiveness by keeping it in memory and assigning it the highest priority for processing as much as possible. A forward and backward sweeping execution strategy is then proposed to further accelerate the convergence. Experimental results show that HotGraph can reduce the number of vertex state updates processed by 51.5 percent, compared with state-of-the-art schemes. Applying our optimizations further reduces this number by 72.6 percent and the execution time by 80.8 percent.},

	Abstract = {The single source shortest path (SSSP) problem lacks parallel solutions which are fast and simultaneously work-efficient. We propose simple criteria which divide Dijkstra's sequential SSSP algorithm into a number of phases, such that the operations within a phase can be done in parallel. We give a PRAM algorithm based on these criteria and analyze its performance on random digraphs with random edge weights uniformly distributed in [0,1]. We use the G                     (n, d/n) model: the graph consists of n nodes and each edge is chosen with probability d/n. Our PRAM algorithm needs O(n                     1/3 log n) log n) time and O                     (n log n+dn) work with high probability (whp). We also give extensions to external memory computation. Simulations show the applicability of our approach even on non-random graphs.},

	Abstract = {
  Most stencil computations allow tile-wise concurrent start, i.e., there always
exists a face of the iteration space and a set of tiling hyperplanes such that
all tiles along that face can be started concurrently. This provides load
balance and maximizes parallelism. However, existing automatic tiling
frameworks often choose hyperplanes that lead to pipelined start-up and load
imbalance. We address this issue with a new tiling technique that ensures
concurrent start-up as well as perfect load-balance whenever possible. We first
provide necessary and sufficient conditions on tiling hyperplanes to enable
concurrent start for programs with affine data accesses. We then provide an
approach to find such hyperplanes. Experimental evaluation on a 12-core Intel
Westmere shows that our code is able to outperform a tuned domain-specific
stencil code generator by 4% to 27%, and previous compiler techniques by a
factor of 2x to 10.14 x.

	Abstract = {
  Affine transformations have proven to be very powerful for loop restructuring
    due to their ability to model a very wide range of transformations.  A
    single multi-dimensional affine function can represent a long and complex
    sequence of simpler transformations. Existing affine transformation
    frameworks like the Pluto algorithm, that include a cost function for
    modern multicore architectures where coarse-grained parallelism and
    locality are crucial, consider only a sub-space of transformations to avoid
    a combinatorial explosion in finding the transformations. The ensuing
    practical tradeoffs lead to the exclusion of certain useful
    transformations, in particular, transformation compositions involving loop
    reversals and loop skewing by negative factors. In this paper, we propose
    an approach to address this limitation by modeling a much larger space of
    affine transformations in conjunction with the Pluto algorithm's cost
    function. We perform an experimental evaluation of both, the effect on
    compilation time, and performance of generated codes.  The evaluation shows
    that our new framework, Pluto+, provides no degradation in performance in
    any of the Polybench benchmarks.  For Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) codes
    with periodic boundary conditions, it provides a mean speedup of 1.33$\times$ over
    Pluto.  We also show that Pluto+ does not increase compile times
    significantly.  Experimental results on Polybench show that Pluto+
    increases overall polyhedral source-to-source optimization time only by
    15%. In cases where it improves execution time significantly, it increased
    polyhedral optimization time only by 2.04$\times$.},

	Abstract = {Programmers who need high performance currently rely on low-level, architecture-specific programming models (e.g. OpenMP for CMPs, CUDA for GPUs, MPI for clusters). Performance optimization with these frameworks usually requires expertise in the specific programming model and a deep understanding of the target architecture. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are a promising alternative, allowing compilers to map problem-specific abstractions directly to low-level architecture-specific programming models. However, developing DSLs is difficult, and using multiple DSLs together in a single application is even harder because existing compiled solutions do not compose together. In this paper, we present four new performance-oriented DSLs developed with Delite, an extensible DSL compilation framework. We demonstrate new techniques to compose compiled DSLs embedded in a common backend together in a single program and show that generic optimizations can be applied across the different DSL sections. Our new DSLs are implemented with a small number of reusable components (less than 9 parallel operators total) and still achieve performance up to 125x better than library implementations and at worst within 30{\%} of optimized stand-alone DSLs. The DSLs retain good performance when composed together, and applying cross-DSL optimizations results in up to an additional 1.82x improvement.},

	Abstract = {The Store Model of Halpern-Meyer-Trakhtenbrot is shown---after suitable repair---to be a fully abstract model for a limited fragment of Algol in which procedures do not take procedure parameters. A simple counterexample involving a parameter of program type shows that the model is not fully abstract in general. Previous proof systems for reasoning about procedures are typically sound for the HMT store model, so it follows that theorems about the counter-example are independent of such proof systems. Based on a generalization of standard cpo-based models to structures called locally complete partial orders (lcpo's), improved models and stronger proof rules are developed to handle such examples.},

	Abstract = {Traditional denotational semantics assigns radically different meanings to one and the same phrase depending on the rest of the programming language. If the language is purely functional, the denotation of a numeral is a function from environments to integers. But, in a functional language with imperative control operators, a numeral denotes a function from environments and continuations to integers. This paper introduces a new format for denotational language specifications, extended direct semantics, that accommodates orthogonal extensions of a language without changing the denotations of existing phrases. An extended direct semantics always maps a numeral to the same denotation: the injection of the corresponding number into the domain of values. In general, the denotation of a phrase in a functional language is always a projection of the denotation of the same phrase in the semantics of an extended language---no matter what the extension is. Based on extended direct semantics, it is also possible to construct interpreters for complete languages by composing interpreters for language fragments.},

The main novelty is a relational interpretation of open types (as needed for parametricity reasoning) that include general reference types. The interpretation uses a new approach to modeling references.},

	Abstract = {Many concrete notions of function application, suitable for interpreting typed lambda calculi with recursive types, have been introduced in the literature. These arise in different fields such as set theory, multiset theory, type theory and functor theory and are apparently unrelated. In this paper we introduce the general concept of applicative exponential structure and show that it subsumes all these notions. Our approach is based on a generalization of the notion of intersection type. We construe all these structures in a finitary way, so as to be able to utilize uniformly a general form of type assignment system for defining the interpretation function. Applicative exponential structures are just combinatory algebras, in general. Our approach suggests a wide variety of entirely new concrete notions of function application: e.g. in connection with boolean sets. Applicative exponential structures can be used for modeling various forms of non-deterministic operators.},

	Abstract = {We present a type-based flow analysis for simply typed lambda calculus with booleans, data-structures and recursion. The analysis is exact in the following sense: if the analysis predicts a redex, there exists a reduction sequence (using standard reduction plus context propagation rules) such that this redex will be reduced. The precision is accomplished using intersection typing.It follows that the analysis is non-elementary recursive -- more surprisingly, the analysis is decidable. We argue that the specification of such an analysis provides a good starting point for developing new flow analyses and an important benchmark against which other flow analyses can be compared. Furthermore, we believe that the techniques employed for stating and proving exactness are of independent interest: they provide methods for reasoning about the precision of program analyses.A preliminary version of this paper has previously been published (Mossin 1997b). The present paper extends, elaborates and cor},

	Abstract = {Invariance of interpretation by $\beta$-conversion is one of the
              minimal requirements for any standard model for the
              $\lambda$-calculus. With the intersection type systems being a
              general framework for the study of semantic domains for the
              $\lambda$-calculus, the present paper provides a (syntactic)
              characterisation of the above mentioned requirement in terms of
              characterisation results for intersection type assignment systems.
              Instead of considering conversion as a whole, reduction and
              expansion will be considered separately. Not only for usual
              computational rules like $\beta$, $\eta$, but also for a number of
              relevant restrictions of those. Characterisations will be also
              provided for (intersection) filter structures that are indeed
              $\lambda$-models.},

@article{Barendregt:1983aa,
	Abstract = {In [6, p. 317] Curry described a formal system assigning types to terms of the type-free λ-calculus. In [11] Scott gave a natural semantics for this type assignment and asked whether a completeness result holds.Inspired by [4] and [5] we extend the syntax and semantics of the Curry types in such a way that filters in the resulting type structure form a domain in the sense of Scott [12]. We will show that it is possible to turn the domain of types into a λ-model, among other reasons because all λ-terms possess a type. This model gives the completeness result for the extended system. By a conservativity result the completeness for Curry's system follows.Independently Hindley [8], [9] has proved both completeness results using term models. His method of proof is in some sense dual to ours.For λ-calculus notation see [1].},

	Abstract = {Refinement types are an effective language-based verification technique. However, as any expressive typing discipline, its strength is its weakness, imposing sometimes undesired rigidity. Guided by abstract interpretation, we extend the gradual typing agenda and develop the notion of gradual refinement types, allowing smooth evolution and interoperability between simple types and logically-refined types. In doing so, we address two challenges unexplored in the gradual typing literature: dealing with imprecise logical information, and with dependent function types. The first challenge leads to a crucial notion of locality for refinement formulas, and the second yields novel operators related to type- and term-level substitution, identifying new opportunity for runtime errors in gradual dependently-typed languages. The gradual language we present is type safe, type sound, and satisfies the refined criteria for gradually-typed languages of Siek et al. We also explain how to extend our approach to richer refinement logics, anticipating key challenges to consider.},

@inproceedings{Jafery:2017aa,
	Abstract = {A long-standing shortcoming of statically-typed functional languages is that type checking does not rule out pattern-matching failures (run-time match exceptions). Refinement types distinguish different values of datatypes; if a program annotated with refinements passes type checking, pattern-matching failures become impossible. Unfortunately, refinement is a monolithic property of a type, exacerbating the difficulty of adding refinement types to nontrivial programs.

Gradual typing has explored how to incrementally move between static typing and dynamic typing. We develop a type system with gradual sums that combines refinement with imprecision. Then, we develop a bidirectional version of the type system, which rules out excessive imprecision, and give a type-directed translation to a target language with explicit casts. We prove that the static sublanguage cannot have match failures, that a well-typed program remains well-typed if its type annotations are made less precise, and that making annotations less precise causes target programs to fail later. Several of these results correspond to criteria for gradual typing given by Siek et al. (2015).},

	Abstract = {ChaNGa is an N-body cosmology simulation application implemented using Charm++. In this paper, we present the parallel design of ChaNGa and address many challenges arising due to the high dynamic ranges of clustered datasets. We propose optimizations based on adaptive techniques. We evaluate the performance of ChaNGa on highly clustered datasets: a                                                                                                                     z                      ∼                      0                                                        {\$}z {\backslash}sim0{\$}                 snapshot of a 2 billion particle realization of a 25 Mpc volume, and a 52 million particle multi-resolution realization of a dwarf galaxy. For the 25 Mpc volume, we show strong scaling on up to 128K cores of Blue Waters. We also demonstrate scaling up to 128K cores of a multi-stepping run of the 2 billion particle simulation. While the scaling of the multi-stepping run is not as good as single stepping, the throughput at 128K cores is greater by a factor of 2. We also demonstrate strong scaling on up to 512K cores of Blue Waters for two large, uniform datasets with 12 and 24 billion particles.},

@article{Breazu-Tannen:1991aa,
	Abstract = {We present a method for providing semantic interpretations for languages with a type system featuring inheritance polymorphism. Our approach is illustrated on an extension of the language Fun of Cardelli and Wegner, which we interpret via a translation into an extended polymorphic lambda calculus. Our goal is to interpret inheritances in Fun via coercion functions which are definable in the target of the translation. Existing techniques in the theory of semantic domains can be then used to interpret the extended polymorphic lambda calculus, thus providing many models for the original language. This technique makes it possible to model a rich type discipline which includes parametric polymorphism and recursive types as well as inheritance. A central difficulty in providing interpretations for explicit type disciplines featuring inheritance in the sense discussed in this paper arises from the fact that programs can type-check in more than one way. Since interpretations follow the type-checking derivations, coherence theorems are required: that is, one must prove that the meaning of a program does not depend on the way it was type-checked. Proofs of such theorems for our proposed interpretation are the basic technical results of this paper. Interestingly, proving coherence in the presence of recursive types, variants, and abstract types forced us to reexamine fundamental equational properties that arise in proof theory (in the form of commutative reductions) and domain theory (in the form of strict vs. non-strict functions). },

	Abstract = {The paper provides an informal account of CPL, a new programming language currently being implemented for the Titan at Cambridge and the Atlas at London University. CPL is based on, and contains the concepts of, ALGOL 60. In addition there are extended data descriptions, command and expression structures, provision for manipulating non-numerical objects, and comprehensive input-output facilities. However, CPL is not just another proposal for the extension of ALGOL 60, but has been designed from first principles and has a logically coherent structure.},

@techreport{Milner:1990uq,
	Abstract = {{This paper exhibits accurate encodings of the l-calculus in the ¹-calculus. The former is canonical for calculation with functions, while the latter is a recent step towards a canonical treatment of concurrent processes. With quite simple encodings, two l-calculus reduction strategies are simulated very closely ; each reduction in l-calculus is mimicked by a short sequence of reductions in ¹-calulus. Abramsky's precongruence of applicative simulation over l-calculus is compared with that induced by the encoding of the lazy l-calculus into ¹-calculus ; a similar comparison is made for call-by-value l-calculus. The part of ¹-calculus which is needed for the encoding is formulated in a new way, inspired by Berry's and Boudol's chemical abstract machine. The new formulation is shown to be consistent with the original.}},

	Abstract = {This article presents the formal semantics of a large subset of the C
language called Clight. Clight includes pointer arithmetic,
struct and union types, C loops and structured switch
statements. Clight is the source language of the CompCert
verified compiler. The formal semantics of Clight is a big-step
semantics equipped with traces of input/output events that observes
both terminating and diverging executions.  The formal semantics of
Clight is mechanized using the Coq proof assistant. In addition
to the semantics of Clight, this article describes its integration
in the CompCert verified compiler and several ways by which the
semantics was validated.},

	Abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},

	Annote = {Camlp4 is a preprocessor for OCaml for the implementation of syntax exten- sions using an extensible top down recursive descent parser. New language constructs are translated to OCaml code by syntax expanders that are associated to the syntax extensions. Camlp4 provides quotations and anti-quotations to allow the generation of OCaml code using concrete syntax. The contents of quotations is passed as a string to a quotation expander, which can then process the string in arbitrary ways. A default quotation expander can be defined, but all other quotations have to be typed explictly. The same holds for syntactically ambiguous anti-quotations. As opposed to Maya, the syntax and quotation expanders can not use type information to decide what code to produce.},

@article{Vuduc:2004ly,
	Abstract = {Achieving peak performance from the computational kernels that dominate application                performance often requires extensive machine-dependent tuning by hand. Automatic                tuning systems have emerged in response, and they typically operate by (1)                generating a large number of possible, reasonable implementations of a kernel, and                (2) selecting the fastest implementation by a combination of heuristic modeling,                heuristic pruning, and empirical search (i.e. actually running the code). This paper                presents quantitative data that motivate the development of such a search-based                system, using dense matrix multiply as a case study. The statistical distributions                of performance within spaces of reasonable implementations, when observed on a                variety of hardware platforms, lead us to pose and address two general problems                which arise during the search process. First, we develop a heuristic for stopping an                exhaustive compiletime search early if a near-optimal implementation is found.                Secondly, we show how to construct run-time decision rules, based on run-time                inputs, for selecting from among a subset of the best implementations when the space                of inputs can be described by continuously varying features. We address both                problems by using statistical modeling techniques that exploit the large amount of                performance data collected during the search. We demonstrate these methods on actual                performance data collected by the PHiPAC tuning system for dense matrix multiply. We                close with a survey of recent projects that use or otherwise advocate an empirical                search-based approach to code generation and algorithm selection, whether at the                level of computational kernels, compiler and run-time systems, or problem-solving                environments. Collectively, these efforts suggest a number of possible software                architectures for constructing platform-adapted libraries and applications.},

@article{Laufer:2000uq,
	Abstract = {In Java, an interface specifies public abstract methods and associated public constants. Conformance of a class to an interface is by name. We propose to allow structural conformance to interfaces: any class or interface that declares or implements each method in a target interface conforms structurally to the interface, and any expression of the source class or interface type can be used where a value of the target interface type is expected. We argue that structural conformance results in a major gain in flexibility in situations that require retroactive abstraction over types. Structural conformance requires no additional syntax and only small modifications to the Java compiler and optionally, for performance reasons, the virtual machine, resulting in a minor performance penalty. Our extension is type-safe: a cast-free program that compiles without errors will not have any type errors at run time. Our extension is conservative: existing Java programs still compile and run in the same manner as under the original language definition. Finally, structural conformance works well with recent extensions such as Java remote method invocation. We have implemented our extension of Java with structural interface conformance by modifying the Java Developers Kit 1.1.5 source release for Solaris and Windows 95/NT. We have also created a test suite for the extension.},

@inproceedings{Nagarajan:2001ys,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we survey the design space of a new class of architectures called Grid Processor Architectures (GPAs). These architectures are designed to scale with technology, allowing faster clock rates than conventional architectures while providing superior instruction-level parallelism on traditional workloads and high performance across a range of application classes. A GPA consists of an array of ALUs, each with limited control, connected by a thin operand network. Programs are executed by mapping blocks of statically scheduled instructions to the ALU array and executing them dynamically in dataflow order. This organization enables the critical paths of instruction blocks to be executed on chains of ALUs without transmitting temporary values back to the register file, avoiding most of the large, unscalable structures that limit the scalability of conventional architectures. Finally, we present simulation results of a preliminary design, the GPA-1. With a half-cycle routing delay, we obtain performance roughly equal to an ideal 8-way, 512-entry window superscalar core. With no inter-ALU delay, perfect memory, and perfect branch prediction, the IPC of the GPA-1 is more than twice that of the ideal superscalar core, achieving an average of 11 IPC across nine SPEC CPU2000 and Mediabench benchmarks.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the polymorphous TRIPS architecture which can be configured for different granularities and types of parallelism. TRIPS contains mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture contains four out-of-order, 16-wide-issue Grid Processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes--ILP, TLP, and DLP-demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.},

	Abstract = {Distributed processors must balance communication and concurrency. When dividing instructions among the processors, key factors are the available concurrency, criticality of dependence chains, and communication penalties. The amount of concurrency determines the importance of the other factors: if concurrency is high, wider distribution of instructions is likely to tolerate the increased operand routing latencies. If concurrency is low, mapping dependent instructions close to one another is likely to reduce communication costs that contribute to the critical path. This paper explores these tradeoffs for distributed Explicit Dataflow Graph Execution (EDGE) architectures that execute blocks of dataflow instructions atomically. A runtime block mapper assigns instructions from a single thread to distributed hardware resources (cores) based on compiler-assigned instruction identifiers. We explore two approaches: fixed strategies that map all blocks to the same number of cores, and adaptive strategies that vary the number of cores for each block. The results show that best fixed strategy varies, based on the cores' issue width. A simple adaptive strategy improves performance over the best fixed strategies for single and dual-issue cores, but its benefits decrease as the cores' issue width increases. These results show that by choosing an appropriate runtime block mapping strategy, average performance can be increased by 18%, while simultaneously reducing average operand communication by 70%, saving energy as well as improving performance. These results indicate that runtime block mapping is a promising mechanism for balancing communication and concurrency in distributed processors.},

	Abstract = {As multicore architectures enter the mainstream, there is a pressing demand for high-level programming models that can effectively map to them. Stream programming offers an attractive way to expose coarse-grained parallelism, as streaming applications (image, video, {DSP,} etc.) are naturally represented by independent filters that communicate over explicit data {channels.In} this paper, we demonstrate an end-to-end stream compiler that attains robust multicore performance in the face of varying application characteristics. As benchmarks exhibit different amounts of task, data, and pipeline parallelism, we exploit all types of parallelism in a unified manner in order to achieve this generality. Our compiler, which maps from the {StreamIt} language to the 16-core Raw architecture, attains a 11.2x mean speedup over a single-core baseline, and a 1.84x speedup over our previous work.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a novel scheme to schedule loops for clustered microarchitectures. The scheme is based on a preliminary cluster assignment phase implemented through graph partitioning techniques followed by a scheduling phase that integrates register allocation and spill code generation. The graph partitioning scheme is shown to be very effective due to its global view of the whole code while the partition is generated. Results show a significant speedup when compared with previously proposed techniques. For some processor configuration the average speedup for the {SPECfp95} is 23\% with respect to the published scheme with the best performance. Besides, the proposed scheme is much faster (between 2-7 times, depending on the configuration).},

	Annote = {``Concepts'' are an essential language feature needed to support generic programming in the large. Concepts allow for succinct expression of bounds on type parameters of generic algorithms, enable systematic organization of problem domain abstractions, and make generic algorithms easier to use. In this paper we formalize the design of a type system and semantics for concepts that is suitable for non-type-inferencing languages. Our design shares much in common with the type classes of Haskell, though our primary influence is from best practices in the \Cpp{} community, where concepts are used to document type requirements for templates in generic libraries. The technical development in this paper defines an extension to System F and a type-directed translation from the extension back to System F. The translation is proved sound; the proof is written in the human readable but machine checkable Isar language and has been automatically verified by the Isabelle proof assistant. This document was generated directly from the Isar theory files using Isabelle's support for literate proofs.},

	Annote = {This paper presents the design of G, a new language specifically created for generic programming. We review and identify important language features of C++ and Haskell in light of the past decade of generic library research and development. Based on this analysis we propose and evaluate relevant language design decisions for G. Generic programming is concerned with the construction of libraries of reusable software components and is inherently about programming ``in the large.'' Thus, the design of G places its greatest emphasis on modularity and safety, while also providing run-time efficiency and programmer convenience. This paper focuses on name scoping and type checking for generic functions, support for dispatching to algorithm specializations, support for type associations among abstractions, and separate compilation. The resulting design for G includes three novel aspects: scoped models declarations, nested types in concepts, and optional type constraints on generic functions. },

A field-scale three-dimensional domain with an hourly fluctuating Columbia river stage coupled to flow in highly permeable sediments results in fast groundwater flow rates requiring small time steps. In this work, high-performance computing has been applied to simulate variably saturated groundwater flow and tracer transport at the 300 Area using PFLOTRAN. Simulation results are presented for discretizations up to 10.8 million degrees of freedom, while PFLOTRAN performance was assessed on up to one billion degrees of freedom and 12,000 processor cores on Jaguar, the Cray XT4 supercomputer at ORNL.},

	computers is growing rapidly, with significant implications for the

	I present the results of a broad survey of memory bandwidth and machine
	balance for a large variety of current computers, including uniprocessors,
	vector processors, shared-memory systems, and districuted-memory
	systems. The results are analyzed in terms of the sustainable data
	transfer rates for uncached unit-stride vector operation for each

We investigate the applicability of the MISP greedy algorithm to the graph colouring problem. We prove that the well-known Leighton RLF algorithm and an algorithm obtained by modifying the MISP greedy heuristic behave in exactly the same way.},

	Abstract = {This paper points out the connection between the basic scheduling or timetabling problem with the well known problem of colouring the vertices of a graph in such a way that (i) no two adjacent vertices are the same colour and (ii) the number of colours used is a minimum. We give an algorithm for colouring a graph subject to (i) and give a new easily determined bound for the number of colours needed. This same bound is also a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of the degrees of its vertices. 10.1093/comjnl/10.1.85},

@article{Barendregt:1993cr,
	Abstract = {Illative combinatory logic consists of the theory of combinators or lambda calculus extended by extra constants (and corresponding axioms and rules) intended to capture inference. The paper considers systems of illative combinatory logic that are sound for first-order propositional and predicate calculus. The interpretation from ordinary logic into the illative systems can be done in two ways: following the propositions-as-types paradigm, in which derivations become combinators or, in a more direct way, in which derivations are not translated. Both translations are closely related in a canonical way. The two direct translations turn out to be complete. The paper fulfills the program of Church [1932], [1933] and Curry [1930] to base logic on a consistent system of {\^I}{\guillemotright}-terms or combinators. Hitherto this program had failed because systems of ICL were either too weak (to provide a sound interpretation) or too strong (sometimes even inconsistent).},

	Abstract = {We introduce the blame calculus, which adds the notion of blame from Findler and Felleisen's contracts to a system similar to Siek and Taha's gradual types and Flanagan's hybrid types. We characterise where positive and negative blame can arise by decomposing the usual notion of subtype into positive and negative subtyping, and show that these recombine to yield naive subtyping. Naive typing has previously appeared in type systems that are unsound, but we believe this is the first time naive subtyping has played a role in establishing type soundness. },

	Abstract = {Generic programming centers around the idea of
                  abstracting from concrete, efficient algorithms to
                  obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with
                  different data representations to produce a wide
                  variety of useful software. Four kinds of
                  abstraction-data, algorithmic, structural, and
                  representational-are discussed, with examples of
                  their use in building an Ada library of software
                  components. The main topic discussed is generic
                  algorithms and an approach to their formal
                  specification and verification, with illustration in
                  terms of a partitioning algorithm such as is used in
                  the quicksort algorithm. It is argued that
                  generically programmed software component libraries
                  offer important advantages for achieving software
                  productivity and reliability.},

@inproceedings{jazayeri98:_generic_programming,
	Abstract = {Generic programming is a sub-discipline of computer
                  science that deals with finding abstract
                  representations of efficient algorithms, data
                  structures, and other software concepts, and with
                  their systematic organization. The goal of generic
                  programming is to express algorithms and data
                  structures in a broadly adaptable, interoperable
                  form that allows their direct use in software
                  construction. Key ideas include: Expressing
                  algorithms with minimal assumptions about data
                  abstractions, and vice versa, thus making them as
                  interoperable as possible. Lifting of a concrete
                  algorithm to as general a level as possible without
                  losing efficiency; i.e., the most abstract form such
                  that when specialized back to the concrete case the
                  result is just as efficient as the original
                  algorithm. When the result of lifting is not general
                  enough to cover all uses of an algorithm,
                  additionally providing a more general form, but
                  ensuring that the most efficient specialized form is
                  automatically chosen when applicable. Providing more
                  than one generic algorithm for the same purpose and
                  at the same level of abstraction, when none
                  dominates the others in efficiency for all
                  inputs. This introduces the necessity to provide
                  sufficiently precise characterizations of the domain
                  for which each algorithm is the most efficient. },

                  the subject of an active development characterized
                  by continued controversy over basic principles. In
                  this paper, we formalize a view of these principles
                  somewhat similar to that of J. H. Morris. We
                  introduce an extension of the typed lambda calculus
                  which permits user-defined types and polymorphic
                  functions, and show that the semantics of this
                  language satisfies a representation theorem which
                  embodies our notion of a `correct' type structure.},

	Abstract = {Compiler technology for multimedia extensions must effectively utilize not only the SIMD compute engines but also the various levels of the memory hierarchy: superword registers, multi-level caches and TLB. In this paper, we describe a compiler that combines optimization across all levels of the memory hierarchy with automatic generation of SIMD code for multimedia extensions. At the high-level, model-guided empirical optimization is used to transform code to optimize for all levels of the memory hierarchy. This compiler interacts with a backend compiler exploiting superword-level parallelism that takes sequential code as input and produces SIMD code. This paper discusses how we have combined these technologies into a single framework. Through a case study with matrix multiply, we observe performance results that outperform the hand-tuned Intel MKL library, and achieve performance that is within 4% of the ATLAS self-tuning library with architectural defaults and more than 4X faster than the native Intel compiler.},

@article{Kandemir:2005uq,
	Abstract = {Exploiting spatial and temporal locality is essential for obtaining high performance on modern computers. Writing programs that exhibit high locality of reference is difficult and error-prone. Compiler researchers have developed loop transformations that allow the conversion of programs to exploit locality. Recently, transformations that change the memory layouts of multi-dimensional arrays--called data transformations--have been proposed. Unfortunately, both data and loop transformations have some important drawbacks. In this work, we present an integrated framework that uses loop and data transformations in concert to exploit the benefits of both approaches while minimizing the impact of their disadvantages. Our approach works inter-procedurally on acyclic call graphs, uses profile data to eliminate layout conflicts, and is unique in its capability of resolving conflicting layout requirements of different references to the same array in the same nest and in different nests for regular array-based applications. The optimization technique presented in this paper has been implemented in a source-to-source translator. We evaluate its performance using standard benchmark suites and several math libraries (complete programs) with large input sizes. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the performance of the applications optimized by using the current state-of-the-art techniques by 8.2% on the average. This reduction comes from three important characteristics of the technique, namely, resolving layout conflicts between references to the same array in a loop nest, determining a suitable order to propagate layout modifications across loop nests, and propagating layouts between different procedures in the program--all in a unified framework. The locality optimization technique presented in this paper tries to exploit locality in the innermost loop positions. This strategy, in most cases, generates dependence-free outer loops, which can be safely parallelized.},

                 matrix-matrix multiplication that is part of the widely used GotoBLAS library. Design decisions 
                 are justified by successively refining a model of architectures with multilevel memories. 
                 A simple but effective algorithm for executing this operation results. Implementations on a 
                 broad selection of architectures are shown to achieve near-peak performance.},

	Abstract = {
MLF is a language that extends both ML and System F and combines the
benefits of both. We propose a dag representation of MLF types that
superposes a term-dag, encoding the underlying term-structure with
sharing, and a binding tree, encoding the binding-structure. This
representation is more canonical as it factors out most of the
notational details of the original definition; it is also closely
related to first-order terms. Moreover, it permits a simpler and more
direct definition of type instance that combines type-instance on
first-order term-dags, simple operations on dags, and a control that
allows or rejects potential instances. Thanks to this representation, we
obtain an incremental linear-time unification algorithm for MLF types,
which we prove sound and complete with respect to the specification.
  We also extend term graphs to express constraints on graphs that can
be rewritten incrementally, which suffices to describe all operations
needed by type inference.

The need for direct memory manipulation through pointers is essential in
many applications. However, it is also commonly understood that the use (or
probably misuse) of pointers is often a rich source of program errors.
Therefore, approaches that can effectively enforce safe use of pointers in
programming are highly sought after.  ATS is a programming language with a
type system rooted in a recently developed framework Applied Type System,
and a novel and desirable feature in ATS lies in its support for safe
programming with pointers through a novel notion of {\em stateful
views}. In particular, even pointer arithmetic is allowed in ATS and
guaranteed to be safe by the type system of ATS.  In this paper, we give an
overview of this feature in ATS, presenting some interesting examples based
on a prototype implementation of ATS to demonstrate the practicality of
safe programming with pointer through stateful views.

The wide practice of objected oriented programming (OOP) in current
software practice is evident. Despite extensive studies on typing
programming objects, it is still undeniably a challenging research task to
design a type system that can satisfactorily account for a variety of
features (e.g., binary methods and multiple inheritance) in OOP. In this
paper, we present a typeful approach to implementing objects that makes use
of a recently introduced notion of guarded datatypes. In particular, we
demonstrate how the feature of multiple inheritance can be supported with
this approach, presenting a simple and general account for multiple
inheritance in a typeful manner.

Gentzen's Hauptsatz -- cut elimination theorem -- in sequent calculi
reveals a fundamental property on logic connectives in various logics such
as classical logic and intuitionistic logic.  In this paper, we implement a
procedure in Haskell to perform cut elimination for intuitionistic sequent
calculus, where we use types to guarantee that the procedure can only
return a cut-free proof of the same sequent when given a proof of a sequent
that may contain cuts.  The contribution of the paper is two-fold.  On
the one hand, we present an interesting (and somewhat unexpected) application
of the current type system of Haskell, illustrating through a concrete
example how some typical use of dependent types can be simulated in
Haskell. On the other hand, we identify several problematic issues with
such a simulation technique and then suggest some approaches to addressing
these issues in Haskell.

	Abstract = {Writing performance-critical programs can be frustrating because
   optimizing compilers for imperative languages tend to be
   unpredictable. For a subset of optimizations - those that simplify
   rather than reorder code - it would be useful to prove that a compiler
   reliably performs optimizations. We show that adopting a
   ``superanalysis'' approach to optimization enables such a proof. By
   analogy with linear algebra, we define the nullspace of an optimizer
   as those programs it reduces to the empty program. To span the
   nullspace, we define rewrite rules that de-optimize programs by
   introducing abstraction. For a model compiler we prove that any
   sequence of de-optimizing rewrite rule applications is undone by the
   optimizer. Thus, we are able to give programmers a clear mental model
   of what simplifications the compiler is guaranteed to perform, and
   make progress on the problem of ``abstraction penalty'' in imperative
   languages.},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

	Abstract = {Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, which results in large
                 speed increases for many applications. A simple example
                 that generates factorials at compile time is presented.
                 Although this technique might seem like just a cute C++
                 trick, it becomes powerful when combined with normal
                 C++ code. In this hybrid approach, source code contains
                 two programs: the normal C++ runtime program, and a
                 template metaprogram that runs at compile time.
                 Template metaprograms can generate useful code when
                 interpreted by the compiler, such as a massively
                 inlined algorithm-that is, an implementation of an
                 algorithm that works for a specific input size, and has
                 its loops unrolled. This results in large speed
                 increases for many applications. The article presents a
                 simple template metaprogram that generates a bubble
                 sort algorithm and its performance is analysed.},

                   meta-programming, in particular program generation, and
                   its use in software development. The second part
                   introduces a basic calculus, related to FreshML, that
                   supports program generation (as described through
                   examples and a translation of MetaML into it) and
                   programming in-the-large (this is demonstrated by a
                   translation of CMS into it).},

                 and convenient alternative to C-style callback
                 functions. It allows logical and algebraic expressions
                 to be passed to functions as arguments, and inlined
                 directly into the function body. Expression templates
                 also solve the problem of evaluating vector and matrix
                 expressions in a single pass without temporaries.},

@article{Zhao:2005qf,
	Abstract = {Array syntax, which is supported in many technical programming languages, adds expressive power by allowing operations on and assignments to whole arrays and array sections. To compile an array assignment statement to a uniprocessor, the language processor must convert the statement into a loop that has the same meaning. This process is called scalarization.Scalarization presents a significant technical problem because an array assignment needs to be implemented as if all inputs are fetched before any outputs are stored. Since a loop intermixes loads and stores, the compiler typically allocates a temporary array to hold the intermediate result. Because these extra temporary arrays can cause performance problems in cache, many techniques have been developed to avoid their use or minimize their size.In this paper, we present a novel application of two compiler strategies--loop alignment and loop skewing--to address this problem. We show that these strategies can achieve the asymptotically minimal memory allocation for stencil computations. Our experiments with loop alignment and loop skewing demonstrate that it is extremely effective in improving memory hierarchy performance of Fortran 90 array code on standard uniprocessors. The result should be applicable to other array languages, such as MATLAB.},

	Abstract = {The framework of graph transformation combines the potentials and advantages
of both, graphs and rules, to a single computational paradigm. In this paper we
present some recent developments in applying graph transformation as a rule-based
framework for the specification and development of systems, languages, and tools.
After reviewing the basic features of graph transformation, we discuss a selection of
applications, including the evaluation of functional expressions, the specification of
an interactive graphical tool, an example specification for abstract data types, and
the definition of a visual database query language. The case studies indicate the
need for suitable structuring principles which are independent of a particular graph
transformation approach. To this end, we present the concept of a transformation
unit, which allows systematic and structured specification and programming based
on graph transformation.},

	Abstract = {If the set of atomic formulas is augmented by adding a `universal
formula' and a `null formula', then the equivalence classes of this set under
alphabetic variation form a complete non-modular lattice, with `instance'
as the partial ordering, `greatest common instance' as the meet operation,
and `least common generalization' as the join operation. The greatest common
instance of two formulas can be obtained from Robinson's Unification Algorithm.
An algorithm is given for computing the least common generalization of two
formulas, the covering relation of the lattice is determined, bounds are
obtained on the length of chains from one formula to another, and it is shown
that any formula is the least common  generalization of its set of ground
instances.
A transformational system is a finite set of clauses containing only units
and transformations, which are clauses containing exactly one positive and one
negative literal. It is shown that every unsatisfiable transformational system
has a refutation where every resolution has at least one resolvend which is an
initial clause. An algorithm is given for computing a common generalization of
all atomic formulas which can be derived from a transformational system, and
it is shown that there is no decision procedure for transformational systems.},

	Abstract = {We explore the thesis that type structure is a syntactic discipline
for maintaining levels of abstraction. Traditionally, this view has been
formalized algebraically, but the algebraic approach fails to encompass
higher-order functions.  For this purpose, it is necessary to generalize
homomorphic functions to relations; the result is an `abstraction' theorem
that is applicable to the typed lambda calculus and various extensions,
including user-defined types. Finally, we consider polymorphic functions,
and show that the abstraction theorem captures Strachey's concept of
parametric, as opposed to ad hoc, polymorphism.},

	Abstract = {Classical phantom types are datatypes in which type constraints are expressed using type variables that do not appear in the datatype cases themselves. They can be used to embed typed languages into Haskell or ML. However, while such encodings guarantee that only well-formed data can be constructed, they do not permit type-safe deconstruction without additional tagging and run-time checks. We introduce first-class phantom types, which make such constraints explicit via type equations. Examples of first-class phantom types include typed type representations and typed higher-order abstract syntax trees. These types can be used to support typed generic functions, dynamic typing, and staged compilation in higher-order, statically typed languages such as Haskell or Standard ML. In our system, type constraints can be equations between type constructors as well as type functions of higher-order kinds. We prove type soundness and decidability for a Haskell-like language extended by first-class phantom types.},

@inproceedings{Liang:1995ia,
	Abstract = {We show how a set of building blocks can be used to construct
programming language interpreters, and present implementations
of such building blocks capable of supporting many
commonly known features, including simple expressions,
three different function call mechanisms (call-by-name, callby-
value and lazy evaluation), references and assignment,
nondeterminism, first-class continuations, and program tracing.
The underlying mechanism of our system is monad transformers,
a simple form of abstraction for introducing a wide
range of computational behaviors, such as state, I/O, continuations,
and exceptions.
Our work is significant in the following respects. First,
we have succeeded in designing a fully modular interpreter
based on monad transformers that includes features missing
from Steele's, Espinosa's, and Wadler's earlier efforts.
Second, we have found new ways to lift monad operations
through monad transformers, in particular difficult cases not
achieved in Moggi's original work. Third, we have demonstrated
that interactions between features are reflected in
liftings and that semantics can be changed by reordering
monad transformers. Finally, we have implemented our
interpreter in Gofer, whose constructor classes provide just
the added power over Haskell's type classes to allow precise
and convenient expression of our ideas. This implementation
includes a method for constructing extensible unions
and a form of subtyping that is interesting in its own right.},

	Annote = {Generic programming has recently emerged as a paradigm
for developing highly-reusable software libraries, most notably in C++.
We have designed and implemented a constrained generics
extension for C++ to support modular type-checking of generic
algorithms and to address other issues associated with unconstrained
generics.
To be as broadly applicable as possible, generic algorithms are
defined with minimal requirements on their inputs.
At the same time, to not lose potential efficiency, generic algorithms
may have multiple implementations that exploit features of specific
classes of inputs.
This process of algorithm specialization relies on non-local type
information and conflicts directly with the local nature of modular
type-checking.
In this paper, we review the design and implementation of our
extensions for generic programming in C++, describe the issues of
algorithm specialization and modular type-checking in detail, and
discuss the important design tradeoffs in trying to accomplish both.
We present the particular design that we chose for our implementation,
with the goal of hitting the sweet spot in this interesting design space.},

@inproceedings{Amtoft:2006dt,
	Abstract = {This paper specifies, via a Hoare-like logic, an interprocedural and flow sensitive (but termination insensitive) information flow analysis for object-oriented programs. Pointer aliasing is ubiquitous in such programs, and can potentially leak confidential information. Thus the logic employs independence assertions to describe the noninterference property that formalizes confidentiality, and employs region assertions to describe possible aliasing. Programmer assertions, in the style of JML, are also allowed, thereby permitting a more fine-grained specification of information flow policy.The logic supports local reasoning about state in the style of separation logic. Small specifications are used; they mention only the variables and addresses relevant to a command. Specifications are combined using a frame rule. An algorithm for the computation of postconditions is described: under certain assumptions, there exists a strongest postcondition which the algorithm computes.

	Abstract = {We study the problem of certifying programs combining imperative and
  functional features within the general framework of type theory.
  
  Type theory constitutes a powerful specification language, which is
  naturally suited for the proof of purely functional programs. To
  deal with imperative programs, we propose a logical interpretation
  of an annotated program as a partial proof of its specification. The
  construction of the corresponding partial proof term is based on a
  static analysis of the effects of the program, and on the use of
  monads. The usual notion of monads is refined in order to account
  for the notion of effect. The missing subterms in the partial proof
  term are seen as proof obligations, whose actual proofs are left to
  the user. We show that the validity of those proof obligations
  implies the total correctness of the program.
  We also establish a result of partial completeness.
  
  This work has been implemented in the Coq proof assistant.
  It appears as a tactic taking an annotated program as argument and
  generating a set of proof obligations. Several nontrivial
  algorithms have been certified using this tactic.},

	Annote = {Krivine presents the K machine, which produces weak head normal form results. Sestoft introduces several call-by-need variants of the K machine that implement result sharing via pushing update markers on the stack in a way similar to the TIM and the STG machine. When a sequence of consecutive markers appears on the stack, all but the first cause redundant updates. Improvements related to these sequences have dealt with either the consumption of the markers or the removal of the markers once they appear. Here we present an improvement that eliminates the production of marker sequences of length greater than one. This improvement results in the C machine, a more space and time efficient variant of K. We then apply the classic optimization of short-circuiting operand variable dereferences to create the call-by-need S machine. Finally, we combine the two improvements in the CS machine. On our benchmarks this machine uses half the stack space, performs one quarter as many updates, and executes between 27 0.000000aster and 17lower than our L variant of Sestoft's lazy Krivine machine. More interesting is that on one benchmark L, S, and C consume unbounded space, but CS consumes constant space. Our comparisons to Sestoft's Mark 2 machine are not exact, however, since we restrict ourselves to unpreprocessed closed lambda terms. Our variant of his machine does no environment trimming, conversion to deBruijn-style variable access, and does not provide basic constants, data type constructors, or the recursive let. (The Y combinator is used instead.)},

	Annote = {The past decade of experience has demonstrated that the generic programming methodology is highly effective for the design, implementation, and use of large-scale software libraries. The fundamental principle of generic programming is the realization of interfaces for entire sets of components, based on their essential syntactic and semantic requirements, rather than for any particular components. Many programming languages have features for describing interfaces between software components, but none completely support the approach used in generic programming. We have recently developed G, a language designed to provide first-class language support for generic programming and large-scale libraries. In this paper, we present an overview of G and analyze the interdependence between language features and libraries design in light of a complete implementation of the Standard Template Library using G. In addition, we discuss important issues related to modularity and encapsulation in large-scale libraries and how language support for validation of components in isolation can prevent many common problems in component integration. },

	Annote = {``Concepts'' are an essential language feature needed to support generic programming in the large. Concepts allow for succinct expression of bounds on type parameters of generic algorithms, enable systematic organization of problem domain abstractions, and make generic algorithms easier to use. In this paper we present the design of a type system and semantics for concepts that is suitable for non-type-inferencing languages. Our design shares much in common with the type classes of Haskell, though our primary influence is from best practices in the \Cpp{} community, where concepts are used to document type requirements for templates in generic libraries. Concepts include a novel combination of associated types and same-type constraints that do not appear in type classes, but that are similar to nested types and type sharing in ML.},

@inproceedings{Gordon:2001nr,
	Abstract = {The Microsoft .NET Framework is a new computing architecture designed to support a variety of distributed applications and web-based services. .NET software components are typically distributed in an object-oriented intermediate language, Microsoft IL, executed by the Microsoft Common Language Runtime. To allow convenient multi-language working, IL supports a wide variety of high-level language constructs, including class-based objects, inheritance, garbage collection, and a security mechanism based on type safe execution.This paper precisely describes the type system for a substantial fragment of IL that includes several novel features: certain objects may be allocated either on the heap or on the stack; those on the stack may be boxed onto the heap, and those on the heap may be unboxed onto the stack; methods may receive arguments and return results via typed pointers, which can reference both the stack and the heap, including the interiors of objects on the heap. We present a formal semantics for the fragment. Our typing rules determine well-typed IL instruction sequences that can be assembled and executed. Of particular interest are rules to ensure no pointer into the stack outlives its target. Our main theorem asserts type safety, that well-typed programs in our IL fragment do not lead to untrapped execution errors.Our main theorem does not directly apply to the product. Still, the formal system of this paper is an abstraction of informal and executable specifications we wrote for the full product during its development. Our informal specification became the basis of the product team's working specification of type-checking. The process of writing this specification, deploying the executable specification as a test oracle, and applying theorem proving techniques, helped us identify several security critical bugs during development.},

	Abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP, is a general framework for programming hybrid systems in a high-level, declarative manner. The key ideas in FRP are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are time-ordered sequences of discrete-time event occurrences. FRP is the essence of Fran, a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for programming reactive animations, but FRP is now also being used in vision, robotics and other control systems applications. In this paper we explore the formal semantics of FRP and how it relates to an implementation based on streams that represent (and therefore only approximate) continuous behaviors. We show that, in the limit as the sampling interval goes to zero, the implementation is faithful to the formal, continuous semantics, but only when certain constraints on behaviors are observed. We explore the nature of these constraints, which vary amongst the FRP primitives. Our results show both the power and limitations of this approach to language design and implementation. As an example of a limitation, we show that streams are incapable of representing instantaneous predicate events over behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Generic programming centers around the idea of abstracting from concrete? ef 
 cient algorithms to obtain generic algorithms that can be combined with di erent
data representations to produce a wide variety of useful software  For example? a
class of generic sorting algorithms can be de ned which work with  nite sequences
but which can be instantiated in di erent ways to produce algorithms working on
arrays or linked lists 
Four kinds of abstraction -- data, algorithmic, structural, and representational --
are discussed, with examples of their use in building an Ada library of software
components  The main topic discussed is generic algorithms and an approach to
their formal speci cation and verification, with illustration in terms of a partitioning
algorithm such as is used in the quicksort algorithm  It is argued that generically
programmed software component libraries o er important advantages for achieving
software productivity and reliability },

	Abstract = {This paper examines the old question of the relationship between ISWIM and the ?-calculus, using the distinction between call-by-value and call-by-name. It is held that the relationship should be mediated by a standardisation theorem. Since this leads to difficulties, a new ?-calculus is introduced whose standardisation theorem gives a good correspondence with ISWIM as given by the SECD machine, but without the letrec feature. Next a call-by-name variant of ISWIM is introduced which is in an analogous correspondence withthe usual ?-calculus. The relation between call-by-value and call-by-name is then studied by giving simulations of each language by the other and interpretations of each calculus in the other. These are obtained as another application of the continuation technique. Some emphasis is placed throughout on the notion of operational equality (or contextual equality). If terms can be proved equal in a calculus they are operationally equal in the corresponding language. Unfortunately, operational equality is not preserved by either of the simulations.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the new Java memory model, which has been revised as part of Java 5.0. The model specifies the legal behaviors for a multithreaded program; it defines the semantics of multithreaded Java programs and partially determines legal implementations of Java virtual machines and compilers.The new Java model provides a simple interface for correctly synchronized programs -- it guarantees sequential consistency to data-race-free programs. Its novel contribution is requiring that the behavior of incorrectly synchronized programs be bounded by a well defined notion of causality. The causality requirement is strong enough to respect the safety and security properties of Java and weak enough to allow standard compiler and hardware optimizations. To our knowledge, other models are either too weak because they do not provide for sufficient safety/security, or are too strong because they rely on a strong notion of data and control dependences that precludes some standard compiler transformations.Although the majority of what is currently done in compilers is legal, the new model introduces significant differences, and clearly defines the boundaries of legal transformations. For example, the commonly accepted definition for control dependence is incorrect for Java, and transformations based on it may be invalid.In addition to providing the official memory model for Java, we believe the model described here could prove to be a useful basis for other programming languages that currently lack well-defined models, such as C++ and C#.},
